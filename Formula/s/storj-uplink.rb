  # Upstream creates stable releases and marks them as "pre-release" before
  # release (though some versions have permanently remained as "pre-release"),
  # so it's necessary to check releases. However, upstream has not marked
  # recent releases as "latest", so it's necessary to check all releases.
  # NOTE: We should return to using the `GithubLatest` strategy if/when
  # upstream reliably marks stable releases as "latest" again.
