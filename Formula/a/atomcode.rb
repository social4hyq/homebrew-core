    # The binary embeds webui/dist via rust-embed at compile time, but those
    # built assets are gitignored and so absent from the source tarball. Build
    # the frontend first, otherwise /webui serves a blank page. (cargo fetches
    # crates over the network during the build, so npm can fetch deps too.)

    # `brew upgrade atomcode` instead of rewriting the binary itself.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The 'CodingPlan' feature is only supported in official builds from AtomGit
      due to upstream licensing/anti-abuse restrictions.

      Since this formula is built from source by Harmonybrew, CodingPlan will NOT
      be available.

      If you strictly require CodingPlan, please use the official build.
      Get it from the official website:
